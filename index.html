								<h2 class="align-center"> Why did I make CHUNGUSCOIN? </h2>
								<h3 class="align-center" style="font-size:19px"> I've always been a big fan of Cryptocurrency but more than anything I liked the idea of Dogecoin. The idea that a currency created as a joke, based on a meme was doing so much better than many other forms of cryptocurrency was very fun to me. Unforchunately upon I realized this would not last. Not because of the people investing, but because the currency itself was not designed to be successful. The community behind it did everything right but the sad reality is Dogecoin was doomed to fail from the start. <br> First of all the difficulty of mining dogecoin currency never increases so when demand increases, supply increases with it. Secondly the blockchain isn't very secure it's roots show when we see it was just copied from an opensource project made in 2013. Lastly Dogecoin just wasn't designed to grow, their is NO LIMIT to how much dogecoin can be mined, which combined with the fact that it never gets more difficult to mine, creates a big roadblock in it's growth as supply and demand will almost always match. <br> Dogecoin was fun but if we want to show everyone that a meme currency can top the charts then it's time to invest in Chunguscoin, the supperior crypto currency.</h3>

								<h3> •Chunguscoin has a total supply of 336 million coins. </h3> <br>
								<h3> •Chunguscoin has a blocktime of 1 minute.<!--0.625 minutes.--></h3> <br>
								<h3> •Chunguscoin is completely opensource software.</h3> <br>
								<h3> •Chunguscoin is designed with high potential for growth.</h3> <br>
								</ul>
								<!-- <p>I have always liked the idea of cryptocurrency, But I'm not blind to the flaws of cryptocurrency either. It has been proven time and time again that things like bitcoin and etherium are not special. They are bubbles and they can be popped. Many investors understood this and resorted to supporting the crytpocurrency: Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency designed as satire against other forms of crypto. I too was excited that me and my peers could make Dogecoin spike but upon researching I noticed some big problems. I noticed</p> -->
